        Let's force the companies profiting from refugee detention out of our
        universities and hospitals
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Australia's immigration detention centres rely on the services provided
        by private businesses. No universities or hospitals should have business
        with the companies that profit from the abuse, murder and torture of
        Refugees in detention.

      <p className="mb-6">
        Use this directory to find out if your university of hospital engages
        with the businesses that form part of the detention supply chain. Then
        follow the steps to get these institutions to divest from these
        companies.

      <blockquote className="font-bold mb-6">
        “We must put pressure on all those organisations and individuals who
        benefit from the Refugee detention business. Our oppressed lives are not
        your capitalist pay walls”
      </blockquote>
      <p className="mb-6">
        The lack of transparency and accountability in Australian run detention
        centres is something that has been widely reported and acknowledged by
        international human rights groups including the UN. There have been many
        inquiries and many reports of deaths and sexual abuse within these camps
        yet nothing has changed because the Australian government is not being
        held accountable. Refugees challenging the mandatory detention policy in
        the courts have seen their cases mishandled, unfairly dismissed and
        processed without proper adherence to refugee rights protocol.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6">
        The Australian response to refugees, particularly those arriving by
        boat, is one of the most punitive in the world, and this means
        contracting with detention companies will tarnish the reputations of
        your institutions in the future. We should all be against human rights
        violations in offshore and onshore camps in any case, most particularly
        if we otherwise make corporate commitments to human rights and equal
        opportunity. It is the right thing to do.
